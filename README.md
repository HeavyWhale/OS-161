# Introduction

Taken from https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/sys161manual/:

System/161 is a synthetic (read: made up) hardware platform designed specifically for teaching operating systems and for experimental operating system hacking. It includes a simulated CPU, system bus, and bus devices that are realistic but simple and easy to work with.

New in System/161 2.x: support for multiprocessor and multicore system configurations.
